<blockquote cite="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X-wing_starfighter">X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled the High Galactic script's character "X" in attack formation.They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils and proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters and T-65C-A2 X-wings in many battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.

Approximately thirty years later, a different and upgraded variation of X-wing, the T-70, was used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Defense Fleet. </blockquote>
